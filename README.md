<p><b>DISSERTATION CHAPTER IV</b></p>

<p><b>Methods</b> 
Three different rounds of serum samples collected in 259 HIV cases and 150 area-age matched controls in Rakai, Uganda were repeatedly measured for AFB1-Lysine adducts to provide long-term AF exposure status of subjects. Logistic regression was used to calculate the odds ratio. In HIV-positive participants, AFB1-lysine adduct levels were compared to HIV stages in each round. The incubation time of AIDS was collated by the serum levels of the adduct. Hazard ratio was obtained using the Cox proportional hazard model, and the proportional hazard assumption was tested using the Schoenfeld residual plot (testing proportional hazard), functional form of covariates </p>
